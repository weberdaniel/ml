# Machine Learning

This repo follows steps of the book "Hands on Machine Learning with C++". In the beginning chapter a lot of repositories and software is being named,
which is put nicely together by a proper CMake Build Setup. 

Some of the packages are easier to install directly to the system. In this case please see the .github/workflow/ml.yml file, which basically downloads all of the dependencies into a docker container.
